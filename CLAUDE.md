# LiftLog — Claude Context

## Project goal

LiftLog is a Progressive Web App for tracking a 4-day bodybuilding split, installable on iPhone via "Add to Home Screen." The user is a first-time web app developer. The app lives at this repo and auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages on push to `main`.

Long-term milestones (roughly):
1. ✅ PWA shell + Cloudflare deployment
2. ✅ Dashboard with 4 day cards, week date range
3. ✅ Workout logging + IndexedDB persistence
4. ✅ Recommended weights (progressive overload) + inline set editing
5. ✅ History view + session editing
6. ✅ Day/exercise editing (add, remove, rename exercises per day)
7. ✅ Google OAuth login + cloud sync
8. ✅ Exercise metadata (muscle groups, equipment, weight type) + metrics dashboard
9. ✅ Progress charts (custom CSS bar/line charts)
10. ✅ Rest timer (auto-starts on logging a set; adjustable, with haptic buzz)
11. ✅ Data-driven coaching engine (`insights.ts`) — fractional weekly set-volume per
    muscle vs the 10–20 hard-set target, e1RM plateau/trend detection, prioritized
    recommendations + next-workout suggestion. Surfaced on the Dashboard (Coach card)
    and in Metrics (Coach section).
12. ✅ Configurable program start date (Settings screen) + week-over-week volume delta
13. ✅ Rev 2: double-progression recommendation engine with deload detection,
    shared analytics core (`analytics.ts`), Settings screen, "last time" context
    on exercise cards, Vitest test suite, worker payload validation

**Future milestones:**
- Delta-based sync — the current full-replace, last-writer-wins sync is the biggest remaining architectural risk (two devices logging on the same day can drop a session; pendingSessions only patches one case). A per-session upsert protocol with tombstones is the fix.
- RPE/RIR logging — one optional field per set would let the engine distinguish "grinding at RPE 10" from "easy reps," making deload detection much sharper.
- In-workout session persistence — sets live only in React state until "Finish Workout"; an accidental app kill loses the session. Draft-session storage in IDB would fix it.
- Mesocycle awareness — planned accumulation/deload weeks rather than reactive-only deloads; the configurable start date is the foundation.
- Unit preference (kg/lb), exercise substitution suggestions from the equipment/workout-type taxonomy (the metadata already exists to power this), and worker-side tests with vitest-pool-workers.
- Exercise swap suggestions — add a button on exercises in the workout edit screen to suggest a different exercise that hits the same primary muscle group and doesn't repeat any others in the workout.
- Human model graph — interactive human body that shows a heatmap of the muscle groups worked in a time frame, with buttons/interactions to change the scale/window.

## Stack

- **React + Vite + TypeScript** — `npm run dev` to start, `npm run build` to build
- **Vitest + jsdom** — `npm test` (or `npm run test:watch`). Unit tests live next to the
  modules they cover (`src/data/*.test.ts`) and target the pure data layer.
- **IndexedDB** — via a custom `idbReq<T>` promise wrapper in `src/db/database.ts` (no third-party library). Read and write in **separate transactions** to avoid IDB auto-commit bugs; multi-record writes queue all requests synchronously on one transaction and await `txDone(tx)`.
- **localStorage** — for program config, exercise library, exercise metadata, settings, and migration flags. Managed in `src/data/programStore.ts`, `src/data/exercises.ts` and `src/data/settings.ts`.
- **Plain CSS** — no CSS framework, dark theme via CSS custom properties
- **Charts** — hand-rolled CSS/SVG `BarChart`/`LineChart` (no charting dependency)
- **Cloudflare Pages** — auto-deploys from GitHub `main` branch

---

## TypeScript rule — CRITICAL

`tsconfig.app.json` has `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`. This means **all interface/type-only imports must use `import type`**:

```ts
import type { WorkoutDay } from '../data/program';   // ✅
import { WorkoutDay } from '../data/program';         // ❌ crashes at runtime in the browser
```

Value imports are fine as normal: `import { PROGRAM, getWeekNumber } from '../data/program'`.

## iPhone PWA safe area

All sticky headers use: `padding-top: calc(14px + env(safe-area-inset-top))`
Bottom bars use: `padding-bottom: calc(12px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`
Scrollable lists add: `padding-bottom: calc(96px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`

All inputs use `font-size: 16px` to prevent iOS Safari zoom-on-focus.

---

## Auth

The app requires Google OAuth login. No content is shown until the user is authenticated.

- Login: `/api/auth/google` (Google OAuth redirect)
- Logout: `/api/auth/logout`
- Current user: `getLoggedInUser()` in `src/data/sync.ts` — reads from a cookie set by the server
- `LoginView` is shown when `getLoggedInUser()` returns null

---

## Navigation

No router — pure React state in `App.tsx`. The `View` discriminated union:

```ts
type View =
  | { screen: 'dashboard' }
  | { screen: 'workout'; dayId: number }
  | { screen: 'history' }
  | { screen: 'edit-session'; sessionId: number; dayId: number }
  | { screen: 'edit-day'; dayId: number }
  | { screen: 'exercise-list' }
  | { screen: 'exercise-meta'; exerciseId: string; exerciseName: string }
  | { screen: 'metrics' }
  | { screen: 'settings' };
```

Day-scoped views (`workout`, `edit-session`, `edit-day`) look the day up with a fallback:
if the `dayId` no longer exists (program replaced by a sync), the app renders the
dashboard instead of crashing.

`program: WorkoutDay[]` state lives in `App.tsx`, initialized from `getStoredProgram()` (localStorage). On day edits it's updated and saved back.

## IndexedDB schema (version 3)

**`sessions`** — index: `weekNumber`
- `id` (autoincrement), `dayId`, `weekNumber`, `startedAt`, `completedAt?`

**`setLogs`** — index: `sessionId`
- `id`, `sessionId`, `exerciseId`, `setNumber`, `weight`, `reps`

**`exerciseLogs`** — index: `sessionId` (difficulty ratings — feature removed, store kept for compatibility)
- `id`, `sessionId`, `exerciseId`, `difficulty`

v2 added `exerciseMuscles` + `exerciseDetails` stores; v3 deleted them (metadata moved to localStorage).

Key exported functions: `createSession`, `completeSession`, `addSetLog`, `getSession`, `updateSessionDate`, `getCompletedSessionsForWeek`, `getSetLogsForSession`, `deleteSetLogsForSession`, `deleteSetLogsByExerciseId`, `hasSetLogsForExercise`, `migrateExerciseIds`, `purgeEmptySessions`, `dumpIDB`, `restoreIDB`.

Anything that *analyzes* history (dashboard, metrics, coaching, recommendations, history list) goes through `loadTrainingSnapshot()` in `data/analytics.ts` — one `dumpIDB()` read per screen, never per-session queries.

---

## Cloud sync

On app mount, `App.tsx` runs this sequence (only when logged in):
1. `migrateExerciseIds()` — fast local IDB fix, must run **before** WorkoutView reads logs
2. `pullSync()` — pulls server data into IDB + localStorage (clears and replaces)
3. `migrateExerciseIds()` again — in case pull restored old IDs from the server
4. `pushSync()` — if pull found nothing or any IDs were remapped

Sync payload includes: sessions, setLogs, exerciseLogs, program, exercise library, **and
exercise metadata** (muscle/equipment/weight-type overrides). On pull, metadata is *merged*
into local (server wins per exercise; unsynced local edits survive) so the info you enter for
new exercises persists across devices and re-pulls. `pushSync()`/`pullSync()` also run
`purgeEmptySessions()` so ghost/empty workouts can't resurrect through sync.

---

## Progressive overload algorithm (`src/data/recommendations.ts`)

Runs when opening a new (non-edit) workout. WorkoutView loads one training snapshot and, for
each exercise, builds its recent history **across every day it appears in** (up to the last 3
sessions containing that exercise, newest first). `calculateRecommendation(history, exercise)`
implements **double progression** with stall detection, evaluated in order:

1. **Increase** — the last session had at least `exercise.sets` working sets and *every* one hit
   `repHigh`+ reps → add load. Increment = `max(5, round5(weight × 0.025))` (5 lbs normally,
   ~2.5% for heavy lifts like leg press).
2. **Deload** — 3+ consecutive sessions at the same working weight with no e1RM improvement
   (>1%) → drop ~10% and build back up.
3. **Decrease** — average working-set reps fell under `repLow` → ease back ~5%.
4. **Hold** (double progression) — reps are in range → keep the weight, chase reps until
   `sets × repHigh` earns the increase.

The **working weight** of a session is the most-used weight (tie → heaviest), so logged
warm-up/ramp-up sets don't skew the recommendation.

**Bodyweight exercises progress by reps, not load.** When the exercise's `weightType` is
`Bodyweight` *and* the last session's working weight was 0 lbs, the engine switches to rep
progression (`repProgression()` in the same file): the recommendation carries a `targetReps`
per-set goal, total session reps replace e1RM as the stall metric, and the four branches mirror
the weight engine (beat the range → +1 rep goal; stalled 3 sessions → reset to `repLow`; under
range → build back to `repLow`; in range → chase one more rep). If external load *was* logged
(e.g. weighted pull-ups with a belt), the normal weight engine applies. ExerciseCard shows
"↑ N reps" instead of a weight when `targetReps` is set.

Returns `{ weight, targetReps?, direction, kind, reason }` (`kind`: `increase`/`hold`/`decrease`/`deload`).
ExerciseCard pre-fills the weight input (only while untouched) and shows the reason as a
colour-coded chip, plus a "Last time" line with the previous session's sets. The engine is fully
covered by `recommendations.test.ts`.

---

## Coaching engine (`src/data/insights.ts`)

`computeCoaching(program, snapshot)` takes a `TrainingSnapshot` (from `analytics.ts`) and produces:
- **Per-muscle weekly set volume** using *fractional* sets — a primary muscle counts as 1 hard set,
  each secondary muscle as 0.5 — scored against the 10–20 hard-set hypertrophy range
  (`low`/`optimal`/`high`). Muscle involvement resolves via override → master list → name match.
- **Strength trends** — best Epley e1RM per session per exercise; over the last 3 sessions a
  >±3% change is `up`/`down`, otherwise `flat` (a plateau).
- **Prioritized insights** — under-trained muscles, plateaus/declines, and a couple of "climbing"
  positives, capped at 6 and sorted by priority. Under-trained-muscle nudges are limited to
  muscles *not* worked in the last 2 sessions and capped at 4, so the Coach stays focused
  instead of listing every muscle below target.
- **Next workout** — the program day longest since last trained.

Surfaced on the Dashboard (Coach card: next day + top insight) and Metrics (full Coach section).
`SETS_TARGET_LOW`/`SETS_TARGET_HIGH` are exported and shared with MetricsView.

---

## Exercise data architecture

`src/data/exercises.ts` is the single source of truth for the 28 built-in exercises:
- `EXERCISES: ExerciseDef[]` — id, name, primaryMuscle, secondaryMuscles, workoutType, equipment, weightType
- `EXERCISE_MAP: Map<string, ExerciseDef>` — fast lookup by id
- `getExerciseMeta(id)` — returns metadata, preferring user overrides from `liftlog_exercise_meta` over defaults
- `saveExerciseMeta(id, meta)` — writes user override to `liftlog_exercise_meta`

`src/data/program.ts` defines the 4-day `PROGRAM` with just id, name, sets, repLow, repHigh per exercise. It no longer contains `RETIRED_EXERCISES` — those are now in `EXERCISES` in exercises.ts.

`src/data/programStore.ts` builds the exercise library from `EXERCISES` on first load, running a one-time migration to strip stale duplicate IDs (the old `-d1/-d2/-d4` suffixed IDs).

---

## Decisions & things to keep in mind

- **DB writes only at "Finish Workout"** — sets are pure React state until save. This makes inline editing/deletion free (no DB rollback needed).
- **Edit session flow** — "Edit Session" in history opens WorkoutView with `existingSessionId`. On save it deletes all old set logs for that session and re-writes them.
- **Exercise library never deletes** — removing an exercise from a day keeps it in the localStorage library so history can still resolve the name by ID.
- **Difficulty rating was removed** — the Easy/Medium/Hard buttons were removed. The `exerciseLogs` IDB store still exists but nothing writes to it.
- **Program start date** is user-configurable in Settings (`settings.ts`, default `2026-06-09`).
  Changing it only affects the week numbering of *new* sessions — historical sessions keep the
  `weekNumber` they were stored with.
- **Settings are device-local** — `liftlog_settings` and `liftlog_rest_seconds` are not synced.
  (Exercise metadata *is* synced as of the metadata-sync change — see Cloud sync.)
- **Empty workouts are purged** — a session with no set logs is a ghost/duplicate and is
  deleted by `purgeEmptySessions()` (startup + around every sync). This also cleaned up the
  legacy duplicate-workout problem for good.
- **Weight 0 is valid** — bodyweight exercises log with 0 lbs; only reps must be positive.
- **Taxonomy merges are normalized on read** — `normalizeOverride()` in `exercises.ts`
  remaps merged-away values from stored overrides (localStorage or a server pull) on every
  read so old data keeps resolving in the dropdowns:
  - Equipment `'Leg Press Machine'` → `'Machine'` (the catch-all for any exercise machine)
  - Muscles `'Front Delts'`/`'Side Delts'`/`'Rear Delts'` → `'Delts'` (duplicates created by
    the collapse are deduped — first mention wins, later ones are nulled)
  - Workout types `'Chest Press'`/`'Overhead Press'`/`'Push Up'` → `'Press'`
- **Taxonomy option arrays are alphabetical** — `MUSCLE_GROUPS`, `WORKOUT_TYPES`,
  `EQUIPMENT_OPTIONS`, `WEIGHT_TYPES` render directly as dropdowns; keep them sorted when
  adding values.
- **`e.stopPropagation()`** is used on nested buttons (Edit, ×) inside tappable cards to prevent triggering parent onClick.
- **White screen with no terminal error** after adding new files = Vite HMR confusion. Fix: hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) + restart dev server.
- **Exercise ID migration** — old builds used `-d1`/`-d2`/`-d4` suffixed IDs for exercises that appeared in multiple days. The remap lives in `src/data/legacyIds.ts` (`LEGACY_ID_MAP`/`canonicalizeId`). It is applied in **two** places that must stay in sync: `migrateExerciseIds()` in `database.ts` (set logs — run before any code that reads set logs by exercise ID) **and** `getStoredProgram()` in `programStore.ts` (the stored program on every read). Fixing only the set logs is not enough: if the stored program still holds a legacy ID, every new workout re-creates legacy-ID set logs, so both must be canonicalized.

## Future Roadmap (V3)

These are the highest-leverage improvements identified in the Rev 2 audit. Implement them in
roughly this order when ready — each one builds on the previous.

### 1. Delta-based sync
**The biggest remaining architectural risk.** The current sync is full-replace, last-writer-wins:
`pushSync()` sends the entire IDB and `pullSync()` wipes local IDB and restores from server.
On two concurrent devices (phone + desktop) this silently drops whichever device synced last.

Fix: move to per-session upsert with tombstones. Each `session` row gets a `deletedAt` timestamp
instead of being physically deleted. The worker merges by `startedAt` (the natural dedup key) and
returns only rows newer than the client's `lastSyncAt`. This also eliminates the `pendingSessions`
localStorage workaround entirely.

### 2. RPE / RIR logging
The deload trigger today fires purely on e1RM stagnation across 3 sessions, which can't
distinguish "I was grinding at RPE 10" from "these were easy reps." One optional `rpe` field per
set (scale 1–10, blank = untracked) lets the engine confirm fatigue before recommending a deload
and detect under-effort when reps stay in range but RPE is low.

Implementation: add `rpe INTEGER` to `setLogs` IDB store (schema v4), show a small tap-to-set
chip next to each logged set row, update `calculateRecommendation` to factor in average RPE.
No UI change is needed if the field is left blank — fully backwards-compatible.

### 3. In-workout session persistence (draft sessions)
Sets live only in React state from "Start Workout" until "Finish Workout." An accidental app kill
or Safari tab eviction silently loses the whole session.

Fix: write a draft session to IDB as sets are logged (not just at finish), keyed to a
`draftSessionId` in localStorage. On app mount, detect a stale draft and offer to resume or
discard. At "Finish Workout," promote the draft to a completed session atomically. This is the
single biggest UX risk for anyone doing long sessions with spotty connectivity.

### 4. Mesocycle awareness
The current deload is purely reactive (stall → deload). A planned accumulation/deload structure
would let the engine front-run fatigue: e.g., 3 weeks accumulation → 1 deload week, cycling
automatically. The configurable program start date (already in Settings) is the foundation —
extend it to support a `mesocycleLengthWeeks` setting and expose the current mesocycle phase
(accumulation / peak / deload) to the recommendation engine and Coach card.

### 5. Quality-of-life additions
These are independent of each other and can land in any order:

- **Unit preference (kg / lb)** — a single `weightUnit` setting in `settings.ts`; all display
  and input converts via a thin `toDisplay(lbs)` / `fromDisplay(val)` helper. Store always in lbs.
- **Exercise substitution suggestions** — when the Coach flags a muscle as under-trained, surface
  1–2 exercises from `EXERCISES` that target it and match the user's available equipment
  (`taxonomy.ts` already has the data).
- **Worker-side tests** — the `worker/` directory has no test coverage. Add
  `vitest-pool-workers` (Cloudflare's Vitest integration) and cover `validatePush()`, the
  OAuth redirect helper, and the D1 upsert logic.
